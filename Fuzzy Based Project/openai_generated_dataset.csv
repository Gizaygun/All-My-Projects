As we know, the engagement score is calculated using the following formula:

engagement score = (minutes spent on the platform / 60) * (number of views + number of activities)

Hence, we can calculate the number of minutes spent on the platform by the student as follows:

minutes spent = engagement score * 60 / (number of views + number of activities)

3055,21,Junior,Science,65,5.26,28,35,"**

**Solution:** 

The student spends an above-average time of 5.26 hours studying on the platform and viewed a moderate number of 35 materials. The engagement score of 28 indicates that they are not very engaged and they might need to work on their participation levels in the platform.

### **Q7. Which grade has the highest average engagement score?**

**Solution:** 

Engagement score is an important factor in evaluating the learning behavior of a student. The average engagement score is calculated"
3056,24,Junior,Science,77,5.31,66,9,"Solution: 

The student is interested in Science so spends 5.31 hours studying on the platform. The engagement score is 66 which is higher than the average engagement score of 59. This shows that the student is engaged with the content and is actively learning. The student has viewed 9 materials which shows that they are exploring different resources for learning.

Yes, the engagement score is a"
3062,25,Freshman,Math,94,3.65,36,35,"Would you expect them to pass or fail?

We can describe the learning behavior of the student as being highly engaged, as they spend a lot of time studying and view many materials. However, their engagement score is relatively low, which may indicate that they are struggling with the material. It is difficult to say whether they will pass or fail based on this information alone, as factors such as the difficulty of the course and the student's prior knowledge and abilities will also play a role.

hours = 4.0
engagement = 89
materials_viewed = 31

Their engagement score of 49 is slightly below average, but not too low. We can assume they are doing well overall in their Science studies, but we would need more information to know for sure.

There are a few things to unpack from this prompt. Let's start by breaking down the data we have:

- **2.45 hours studying:** This is the amount of time the student spent studying.
- **Engagement score of 61:** This score could mean a number of things, but let's assume it represents a percentage of engagement in the course. For example, if the course had 10 lessons, and the student completed 6 of them, their engagement score would be"
3728,22,Senior,Science,72,8.81,13,49,"**

1. Student spends a lot of time studying, but not too much that might cause burnout and loss of interest for the subject matter.
2. Student has a good engagement score of 13, which means they are actively involved in the course and are more likely to succeed.
3. Student has viewed a high number of materials, indicating a thorough understanding of the subject matter.

**A student interested in Humanities spends about 2.54 hours studying, has an engagement score of 1,"
3729,22,Senior,Art,76,6.16,55,11,"**

The student has a low level of engagement, but they have viewed a significant number of materials. This could indicate that they are interested in the subject matter, but may not be fully utilizing the platform to its fullest extent. 6 hours of studying is a solid amount of time, but the low engagement score suggests that they may not be as actively involved in the material as they could be.

**2. A student interested in Math spends about 1.5 hours studying, has an engagement score"
3730,27,Senior,Science,67,6.22,63,2,"**

* They are spending a decent amount of time studying.
* Their engagement score is above average, indicating that they are actively answering questions and engaging with material on the platform.
* They are not viewing many materials for the amount of time they are spending studying. This could indicate that they are reading more than watching videos or playing games.

## Solution

To answer these questions, we’ll need to calculate the average time spent studying, the average engagement score, and the average number of materials viewed for each subject. We’ll then use these metrics to describe the learning behavior for each subject.

#### Average metrics by subject

| Subject | Avg. Study Time"

<br> 
The student seems to be engaged in the subject matter, but the time spent is less than expected for a student interested in the subject. This could be due to the fact that the student is using various other resources to supplement their learning or they may have other responsibilities that cut into their study time. The engagement score of 50 indicates that the student is not as engaged as they could be with the content. Finally,"
